    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "**Answer: from the above models, I'm choosing Suppot Vector Machines (SVM), Ensemble Method (AdaBoost) and Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB). **\n",
    "\n",
    "**I. Suppot Vector Machines (SVM) ** \n",
    "\n",
    "it is widely used in pattern recognition and classification problems, for example in image and text classification, in biomedical field  - for common desease prediction (the case of diabetes and pre-diabetes).\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main strengths of SVM approach is that it doesn't depend on a pre-defined model (model-free) and doesn't make any assumption of the data (data-driven) as it is non-parametric technique. So it can capture non-linear relatiohsnips.\n",
    "Other advantages are that the training of the model is relatively simple, the trade-off between complexity and error can be controlled easily, it usually provides high accuracy and generalizes very well. \n",
    "\"The key features of SVMs are the use of kernels, the absence of local minima, the sparseness of the solution and the capacity control obtained by optimising the margin.\" - Shawe-Taylor and Cristianini (2004) http://www.svms.org/advantages.html\n",
    "\n",
    "Main weaknesses of SVM are: it might be difficult to interpret results (as it is non-parametric),it can be computationally expensive in high-dimensional space; it heavily relies on the choice of kernel function (and selection of kernel parameters). \n",
    "\n",
    "As SVM is a non-parametric technique, it may have high discriminative power for classification, especially in cases where sample sizes are small and a large number of variables are involved (high-dimensionality space), like in our case. \n",
    "\n",
    "**II.  Ensemble method (AdaBoost with DecisionTree). **\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensemble method learners train multiple classifiers through data or algorithmic diversity and combine them into a single classifier that performs better and is more robust to data quality issues, such as noise or class imbalance, than its constituent classifiers (Prusa, Khoshgoftaar, and Dittman 2015). AdaBoost constructs a “strong” classifier as a linear combination. It has wide application in face recognition, speech processing, biology. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike other powerful classifiers, such as SVM, AdaBoost can achieve similar classification results with much less tweaking of parameters or settings (unless of course you choose to use SVM with AdaBoost). The user only needs to choose: (1) which weak classifier might work best to solve their given classification problem; (2) the number of boosting rounds that should be used during the training phase (http://www.nickgillian.com/wiki/pmwiki.php/GRT/AdaBoost).\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages: AdaBoost can be sensitive to noisy data and outliers. In some problems, however, it can be less susceptible to the overfitting problem than most learning algorithms.  (http://www.nickgillian.com/wiki/pmwiki.php/GRT/AdaBoost).\n",
    "\n",
    "I choose AdaBoost for our problem, as it should be more powerful classifier than a single model (like Decision Tree), it is less complex algorithm than SVM, and because it performs well with the imbalance class (as in our case).  \n",
    "\n",
    "**III. Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB) ** \n",
    "\n",
    "A classical use case for Naive Bayes is document classification: to determine whether a given (text) document corresponds to one or more categories. So it works great with categorization of the news, email spam detection, face recognition, digit recognition, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "An advantage of naive Bayes is that it helps to overcome the curse of dimensionality, as it suumes taht all variables are independent.  It only requires a small number of training data to estimate the parameters necessary for classification (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier>). It also can be used for both binary and mult-iclass classification problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "Its main disadvantage is that it can’t learn interactions between features as it assumes that all variables are independent. If you have highly correlated variables, you need to think which ones to exclude.\n",
    "\n",
    "I choose this algorithm due to its simplicity that can outperform more complex models when the data set isn’t large.\n",

Then it predicts the income classes and checks the prediction errors (vs y_test). \n",
    "\n",
    "2. In the second cycle, the algorithm focuses on the errors made in the 1st cycle. it prioritizes the correct prediction of those instances over rest of the data points. Again, the errors of this cycle will be prioritized in the next one. the Algorithm will repeat it several times (specified number of rounds). \n",
    "\n",
    "3. All the cycles will be later combined to make a final ensembled model. Each cycle will \"vote\" to predict if a person earns more than 50K or not. Each cycle will have a different weight in the final prediction based on its accuracy. The majority of the votes will be used for a final prediction.\n",

I didn't choose \"capital-gain\" and \"capital-loss\" as I assumed that it might be relevant only for some of the individuals, who invest in short-term rather than in long-term period.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. If you were not close, why do you think these features are more relevant?\n",
    " - regarding capital-gain and capital-loss: these 2 features may be a good predictor because, probably, people with higher income are more likely to invest and buy/sell assets. These features help to identify those 25% of the individuals that make more than 50K.\n",
    " - despite my initial thought that \"hours per week\" might not depict the picture correctly (a person can work long hours on different low-paid jobs), it is probably a good estimator after some threshold of values. It might have high correlation with \"occupancy\". \n",

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
